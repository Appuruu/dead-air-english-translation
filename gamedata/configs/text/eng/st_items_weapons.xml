The basis of the ACE Galil rifles is the Galil assault rifle, which in its turn is based on Kalashnikov’s AK rifle. The Galil ACE focuses on ergonomics, ease of use and integration with additional attachments, as well as flexibility in combat - the Galil ACE family includes the three most common types of ammunition in the world (5.56x45 NATO, 7.62x39 M43 and NATO 7.62x51), with multiple barrel lengths for each type. This particular variant utilizes 5.56x45 NATO rounds and has a compact barrel. In the Zone, this assault rifle is a real rarity.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]ATTACHMENTS: \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] NATO suppressor\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ACOG, Barska ES AC10632, EOTech scopes</text>
