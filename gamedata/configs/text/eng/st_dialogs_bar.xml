	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_11">
		<text>So, your first fight? Your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. HeТs here because of his debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight, or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. HeТs gonna fight like a cornered animal. Equipment for todayЕ Lemme thinkЕ How about you two use basic pistols, two boxes of ammo should be plenty. Either kick his ass or we feed you to the dogs - not much of a choice. Go on now.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_12">
		<text>Your last fight didnТt mean shit, youТre still the same piece of meat you were before and no self-respecting person will bet a single mag on you. If you wanna earn some proper cash youТre gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. Your new opponent also got through the first round, and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I donТt like him, to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd doesnТt like that. So, go and show us what you can do! The stakes will increase after this fight - all you gotta do is stay alive. Move it!</text>

		<text>Well, wellЕ YouТre not as much of a pussy as you first seemed. Now itТs time to test you out in a real fight. YouТre up against two guys. The first oneТs called Swede and I donТt remember the second oneТs name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each otherТs guts so donТt worry about them working as a team - theyТre more likely to shoot each other. Today is shotgun day so donТt let them get too close or weТll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are 10:1 so if you win youТll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

		<text>Well, now I can safely say that youТre a fighter, a real fighter. Now itТs time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies - two brothers - on your side. They havenТt fought yet but theyТre brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldnТt expect any real help from them if I were you. YouТre fighting an experienced team, theyТre contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him. Good luck, palЕ YouТre gonna need it.</text>

		<text>YouТve got a special fight today. Even the army has heard about you! DonТt be surprised, they fight here too - thereТs even a general in the crowd. These guys are from the Spetsnaz or OMON. TheyТre well armed and their armour is as good as youТd expect. DonТt worry though, I ainТt gonna leave you out in the rain, either. YouТll get a vest used by Freedom - itТs light so it wonТt slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ainТt no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took Тem at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, theyТll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. TheyТre not well-armed - probably just a few pistols and sawn-offs - but thereТs six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

		<text>Well, youТre almost in the final. Now youТll be fighting a real stalker. HeТs alone but heТs got an assault rifle and heТs inside an exoskeleton. Catch one burst and youТre toast. There will be a surprise that I canТt tell you about tooЕ HereТs my advice: be prepared, itТs gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, go!</text>

There will be 4 other stalkers in the arena: all real pros in exoskeletons but itТs a fair deal this time - youТll get exactly what they have. The only thing is, you donТt get medkits or bandages in a fight to the death. Ready? Go prove youТre the best, GO!</text>

		<text>What is this establishment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_111">
		<text>This is the arena, my little business. A place where stalkers can test their mettle and earn their fame by fighting against the horrors of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_12">
		<text>How do you get the mutants here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_121">
		<text>We made a deal with Duty, instead of killing all the mutants they find they bring the weaker ones here in exchange for cash. Duty gets paid, the mutants get killed, and then I get paid. Everybody wins.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_13">
		<text>Where are you from?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_131">
		<text>I am from many places. I heard about this little backwater and understood that I could earn a good little penny here. So here I am.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
		<text>What are the rules?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
		<text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myself. For challenges, thereТs a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money and tell me the time you need to kill the monster. If you make it - you win, if you donТt - I win.\nBut for the main course, bandits and the ZoneТs other degenerates captured by Duty fight in the arena for their crimes. Some are just stalkers who fancy a fight, and not actually criminals, but whoever leaves the arena in the least amount of pieces gets a sizeable reward. If they keep on winning fights, then more stalkers will come to watch, and the combatants win larger rewards.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_11">
		<text>Good to see you stalker, welcome to the arena.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_21">
		<text>So, what are you waiting for? Get into the cage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_31">
		<text>Sorry, thereТs nothing to fight against yet. Wait for a day or two until we can catch a new mutant.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_41">
		<text>There you are! Well done! HereТs your win. If you desire another fight for money then just drop in whenever.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_51">
		<text>Sorry, bro, but you lose. Come again next time if you want.</text>
