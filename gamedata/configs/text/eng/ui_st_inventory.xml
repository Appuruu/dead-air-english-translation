		<text>Ionizing radiation poisoning\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Exposure to ionizing radiation poses an extremely high risk to the USS operative. For this reason, every member of USS personnel is required to undergo training which provides them with the ability to adequately measure radiation levels. This skill becomes a key factor in their effectiveness within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The basic unit in the scale of ionizing radiation is millisievert %c[0,210,210,210](mSv)%c[0,170,170,170]. Level of approximately %c[0,210,210,210]8000 mSv %c[0,170,170,170]is usually lethal without a chance of recovery. Radiation levels above the threshold of 1000 mSv (see below) may gradually negatively impact USS operative’s performance. In case of exposure, it is thus strongly advised to administer anti-radiation drugs of appropriate potency as soon as possible. Table 3.2 presents radiation levels with typical symptoms:\n \n%c[0,102,255,0]250 - 1500 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Symptoms are unnoticeable. Long term consequences are negligible.\n \n%c[0,255,255,0]1500 - 3000 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Noticeable moderate to strong sickness, light-headedness, skin stains. Long-term symptoms are mild. Full recovery is possible if treated promptly.\n \n%c[0,255,122,0]3000 - 4500 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Very strong sickness, confusion and dizziness leading to premature death if not treated in relatively short time. Complete cease of hunger and thirst, taint, diarrhoea, peeling of skin and hair loss. High risk of permanent loss of reproduction ability. Restoration of bodily functions is feasible with extensive use of cleansing agents.\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]4500 - 6000 mSv: %c[0,140,140,140]Intensification of the above symptoms. Additionally, permanent damage to central nervous system. Death highly probable.\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]6000 mSv and above: %c[0,140,140,140]Imminent death.

Powerful and constant electric arcs stretched in what appears to be a simple composition of gases could, if harnessed, provide enormous amounts of pure energy. Unfortunately, all attempts to obtain electricity from these anomalies were to no avail since they are extremely unstable and any contact with solid matter results in massive outbursts of energy. Such phenomena are unheard of in modern science as our sensors have registered a sudden rise in both voltage and current that would cause any capacitors currently produced to overheat due to the erratic nature of the anomaly.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Voltage peaks produced during such outbursts amount to %c[0,210,210,210]4,0 megavolts (MV)%c[0,170,170,170], which allows the current to reach as high as %c[0,210,210,210]3,5 meters%c[0,170,170,170] above the ground. Since the outbursts last around %c[0,210,210,210]50 milliseconds%c[0,170,170,170], energy produced inside the anomaly per one outburst is often not enough to kill a healthy grown man. However, extensive health damage and severe trauma should be expected and the second outburst (which is very likely to occur if one does not exit the field promptly) is in most cases fatal.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]As is the case with all static electrical discharges, the best means of protection is increasing electrical resistance of the body. This can be achieved in several ways, primarily by wearing protective, non-conductive clothing.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]For the purposes of USS operations in the Exclusion Zone, effectiveness of all means of electrical resistance and combat armors is measured in the number of kilovolts %c[0,210,210,210](kV)%c[0,170,170,170] a given piece of equipment is able to resist during a single %c[0,210,210,210]3000 kV%c[0,170,170,170] / %c[0,210,210,210]50 ms%c[0,170,170,170] outburst of an electrical anomaly.\n \n%c[0,153,255,255]

Such fields ordinarily take a hemispherical shape with the source at their centre. Of note is that they are able to either immediately kill or induce an unrecoverable coma within seconds of exposure (this applies to any human being not protected with additional equipment). The potency of psy field varies depending on the distance from the source: the weakest being at the edges of the field and increasing at a geometric rate the closer to the source.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]It has been established that beside the main “psy radiation,” each field also produces a faint, low frequency %c[0,210,210,210](50-60 Hz)%c[0,170,170,170] magnetic field which seems completely harmless; this field can be easily detected and measured for the purposes of assessment of the psy field’s main strength.

		<text>Rupture protection\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Rupture protection level remains a significant factor when operating within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and must not be underestimated. This is due to often extremely aggressive and carnivorous fauna which has mutated excessively owing to the special characteristics of the Exclusion Zone.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The collective term %c[0,210,210,210]“mutants”%c[0,170,170,170] refers to beings of animal and possibly human origin which are the outcome of this abnormal evolution. They can take a variety of shapes and forms depending on their progenitor and the extent of mutation - and have at their disposal several means of inflicting damage and killing their prey. Common types of attacks include biting, cutting the skin and clothing with sharp claws, stabbing with protruding fangs, charging at the prey, as well as kicks and punches.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The most popular means of protection against this threat is using clothing manufactured in such a way so as to make it virtually impenetrable by animal attacks. Although normally even a thin layer of protective material can keep you out of harm’s way, in the Exclusion Zone it is advisable to use only specially designed anti-laceration fibers.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Rupture protection values of a certain armor piece are in direct connection to its anti-ballistic protection class. This is especially true of any NIJ %c[0,210,210,210]Class AIII%c[0,170,170,170] and above which have a large number of integrated %c[0,210,210,210]metal plates%c[0,170,170,170].\n \n%c[0,204,0,51]IMPORTANT:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Even though clothing of high durability and thickness can significantly reduce damage inflicted by firearm projectiles and animal attacks of all kinds, the materials the clothing is made of are not indestructible and will slowly degrade, gradually decreasing its environmental and physical protection values. The rate at which armor degrades %c[0,210,210,210]is not a constant value%c[0,170,170,170] and depends on the condition of the unit, which means that %c[0,210,210,210]the condition of equipment will deteriorate the faster the more damaged the equipment is.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]For this reason, it is %c[0,210,210,210]strongly advised%c[0,170,170,170] to undertake maintenance of suits and headgear as frequently as possible and to avoid taking severe, structural damage.\n \n \n</text>

The Zone is an unforgiving place. Although the saying “abandon all hope you who enter here” does not quite apply here, you should never expect anyone to offer you a helping hand. You’re on your own and if you fail, chances are you’ll die a miserable death. Thank the mutants, the weather, emissions or the Zone itself for that, but remember: it’s your fault, you’re to blame, and it’s up to you survive. No matter how you look at it, it’s the law of nature: survival of the fittest. Those who aren’t cut out for this line of work will without a doubt die, and those with more perseverance will live to see another day.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]While a superficial gunshot wound won’t immobilize you completely, it certainly causes %c[0,210,210,210]pain%c[0,170,170,170], and pain is dangerous: it may make your body %c[0,210,210,210]stop functioning%c[0,170,170,170].

It’s the mind. It’s precisely the mind that gives you willpower to withstand the pressure of the Zone and determination to pursue your goals. However, mind is not a constant, it’s a variable. It changes depending on the circumstances. Psychological trauma makes you weak and drains your health. This is especially true of occurrences of immense potency like emissions or anomalies. On the other hand, you can strengthen your mind by eating, drinking, sleeping, in a word: %c[0,210,210,210]by taking care of yourself%c[0,170,170,170]. You can also engage in certain activities to keep your spirit alive, and take various performance-enhancing substances if things go that far.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Even if you fail, you can at least be sure you did all you could, as small as a consolation that may be.
