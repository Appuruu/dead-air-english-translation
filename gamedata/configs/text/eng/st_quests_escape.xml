This thing must be taken down before I lose my mind… A couple of accurate shots would easily solve this problem, but it’s dangerous to get any closer. It would be safer to deal with it from long distances. Unfortunately, no one has a reliable long-range rifle in this village. Maybe you can take this thing down?</text>
