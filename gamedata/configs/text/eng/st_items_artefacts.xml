		<text>A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output is highest on the artifact radiation scale. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artifact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artifact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,225,225] • %c[0,140,140,140] highly valuable</text>

(Side note: it is not recommended to keep this artifact in your possession for longer periods of time as blood clots can be hazardous to your health.) This artifact is also highly sought for by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1 cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artifact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in death of the user.

Another dangerous effect of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artifact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.

Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user’s body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artifact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artifact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artifact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish.

Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artifact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras.

However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artifact on the belt is suicide.

This applies, however, only to the outer layer - underneath, bloodsuckers boast well developed muscles which can be utilized to form a coat of sorts with considerable damage reducing potential, especially in regard to melee attacks. This makes bloodsucker skin a popular choice among experienced hunters who also wear it as a sign of their proficiency. The most unique property it holds is the high resistance to chemical substances and toxic wastes. The reason is that bloodsuckers often live in places with active chemical exposure (underground areas of former research laboratories for example).

This fact to a large degree confirms reports of recon units (especially those scouting around the AMK Industrial Complex) concerning sightings of chimeras surrounded in what looked like an electrical anomaly, producing discharges on contact with any hostile living organism.

Recent analysis shows that not only the hand of the controller is capable of producing psy waves - the whole body is the source of emissions.
