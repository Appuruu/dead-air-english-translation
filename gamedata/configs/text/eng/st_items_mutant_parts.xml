Since the deformation of the body is almost identical in case of all izloms, it is supposed that when the exposure took place all subjects were in the same body position - either because they were in the process of being transported or because someone purposely placed them so. All specimens encountered so far were male and sterile. Hence it can be safely assumed that the izlom population is unable to reproduce, and their number in the Zone is steadily getting lower.
