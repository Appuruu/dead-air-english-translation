		<text>PFM-1 (short for ïðîòèâîïåõîòíàÿ ôóãàñíàÿ ìèíà; NATO name: “Green parrot") used to be a standard-issue anti-personnel mine of the Red Army, employed mainly during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Its widespread utilization during the conflict led to high civilian casualties, especially among children, since randomly scattered mines were often mistaken for toys due to their familiar shape and color. For this reason, the PFM-1 earned a sinister nickname: “Child killer.” Since then, the mine has been replaced by newer models. However, as was the case with a variety of other “retired” weaponry, a large number of these mines has somehow made its way into the Zone, becoming its primary booby-trap explosive. The mine is highly valued mainly for its functionality, user-friendliness, compact size and low weight, while its main drawback is a relatively small amount of explosive material: its power is often insufficient to kill a heavily armored stalker with a single blast. For this reason, the mine should be used in combination with other explosive materials and it acts as an igniter. If it is not armed, the mine will not detonate, even when hit with a gun.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] explosive\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] military item\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] anti-personnel mine\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] triggering mechanism: %c[0,170,170,170]pressure\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] blast power: %c[0,170,170,170]small\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] blast radius: %c[0,170,170,170]2.2 m\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] fragments’ radius: %c[0,170,170,170]none\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] av. number of fragments: %c[0,170,170,170]none\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] explosion delay: %c[0,170,170,170]none</text>
