		<text>Why not? Of course you may… for a contribution to the, say, ensurement of security in the territory. The road to the Bar is safe at the moment, and it is safe only thanks to the regular Duty patrols, as well as strict verifications of anyone passing through this checkpoint. If you are, in fact, someone who won’t be giving us any unnecessary trifle, we must prove it… Well?</text>

		<text>Why every time? We’re not robbers who put a toll on mere passage. The contribution will be five thousand roubles.
