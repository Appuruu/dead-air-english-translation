The M4 fires 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and are gas operated, air cooled, magazine fed, selective fire firearms with a 4 position telescoping stock. As with many carbines, the M4 is handy and more convenient to carry than a full length rifle. It has been adopted by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and is the preferred weapon of the U.S. Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs.\n \n

Providing greater stopping power than the MP5, the UMP45 also produces more recoil. This makes controlling full automatic fire more difficult.

Drawbacks of decreased size, i.e. lowered accuracy and lower muzzle velocity, result in decreased kinetic energy of each fired projectile. To compensate for increased recoil in auto-fire mode, SVU-A features a permanent suppressor which also serves as a very effective muzzle brake.

		<text>The Glock 19 is a smaller version of the Glock 17. Its reduced size made the Glock 19 easier to conceal and carry by military and police forces. The pistol was debuted by Glock GbmH of Austria in 1988. When compared to the Glock 17, the Glock 19 retains the weight of its slide to keep the short recoil operation in check while at the same time shortening the grip and barrel. Many components of the Glock 19 were made interchangeable with the Glock 17, including the magazine. Simply put, the Glock 19 is a compact version of the 17.\n \n

		<text>The IMI Desert Eagle is a semi automatic handgun notable for chambering the largest centerfire cartridge of any magazine fed, self loading pistol and also being the heaviest and blockiest gun of its type. No one knows why IMI thought shooting a caliber of this size out of a handgun was a good idea, even though there are plenty of rounds out there that can do the job without breaking your wrist; this one assumes because of a pissing contest between the .44 and .50 AE. Not only is it heavy and harsh in recoil, you can also use it to bludgeon your enemies to death because of its blockiness and weight. Although militaries and law enforcement around the world, in their moment of sanity, never adopted this brick; Hollywood did, mostly because of its "cool factor" and now is the poster child for gangsters and pimps and a status symbol for those who reached a certain rank in a certain console shooter. Rumour is that there's a stalker with a crowbar wandering around the Zone with a rechambered version of this gun, but it's just a rumour.</text>
