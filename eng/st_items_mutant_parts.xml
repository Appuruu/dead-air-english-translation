		<text>A severed hand of an izlom - an extremely deformed humanoid mutant. It is certain that these creatures used to be humans and that they are the direct result of the second Chernobyl incident. From the remains of their clothing we can deduce that izloms originate from prisoner population that was stationed the Exclusion Zone and sentenced for forced labor. Since the deformation of the body is almost identical in case of all izloms, it is supposed that when the exposure took place all subjects were in the same body position - either because they were in the process of being transported or because someone purposely placed them so. All specimens encountered so far were male and sterile. Hence it can be safely assumed that the izlom population is unable to reproduce, and their number in the Zone is steadily getting lower. For this reason, at present date they remain one of the most rarely encountered type of mutant, and highly deformed, right hand of an izlom constitutes a valuable research object.\n \n
