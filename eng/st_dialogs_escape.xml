		<text>Hey, stalker! What do you need?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_1">
		<text>A fresh face… or have I seen you around before, stalker? I'm the guy around here to see if you need to buy or sell equipment. If you are seeking a source of income, I'm always in need of someone willing to do dirty work. I look over this camp, and all stalkers are welcome here to rest, as long as they stay out of trouble. I'll also warn you not to mess with the military; I pay good money to keep them away from this place. Stalkers should be relatively safe as long as they don't leave camp.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_11">
		<text>Yes, new. I have not been here very long. I finally decided to take a look, and to say hello.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_111">
		<text>Clearly, indicated means. Well, if there are any questions, then ask me, I will answer what I know.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_110">
		<text>More things to tell? Ask while I'm in the mood.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_1119">
		<text>Yes, everything is clear.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_1111">
		<text>I have nothing but money to begin with. Could you suggest me what should I do next?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_11111">
		<text>What should I advise ... Do you have a backpack? If not - here, look, I will sell it for cheap. Comfortable, strong, roomy. A quick reset system to it is a good addition. Why do you need, you ask? You'll guess yourself when you'll have to run around with a full backpack of stuff from dogs. \n If you're sure that you can survive today - take care of the overnight stay. I would suggest a sleeping bag, but last week I sold the last one - I'll give you a blanket to cover for the time being. In the open it will not help much, it hurts the nights are cold, but in the camp near the fire a snooze is the very best thing that you can do. And do not even think of spending the night on someone else's place, decided to take a nap - set up your own place, such rules are here. \n I will not even tell you about the gas mask and the geiger counter - without them, either the experienced stalker, who knows all the paths, walks, or a rookie - you can't survive without those things. \n If you want to hunt, then the knife will do good enough, the boars itself are fresh. There is two types of stoves for different types of fuels, so that the meat can be cooked in any conditions. Or, as an option, disposable sets of fires can kill the mutant by cooking it - mutant is dead and served ready to eat. </text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_111111">
		<text>Oh, my head is all around now, and it's easier to choose. What else?></text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_1112">
		<text>I see you have a lot of textolite, rosin, oil, why do you need this crap? Do stalkers even buy it? </text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_11121">
        <text>They buy it, and how could they not?! For the beginners this is very needed, of course, the garbage is old, and not everyone wants to bother with it. But a smart stalker will find use every type of crap, if he has tools needed at hand. And these tools, by the way, are now very demanding - they are good in the economy, and technicians always have a demand for them. Well, if you still decided that it's not for you to do such a thing - drag all that stuff down here. I'll gladly buy it, the main thing - do not complain about prices.<text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_1113">
		<text>Is there something normal to eat? I got sick from eating breadcrumbs.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_11131">
		<text>Look at you, what kind of intellectual! No, it would be nice to have something to eat, so he complains. Okay, do not frown so, too often the salagoes with such questions come. \ N In general, everything is simple. Good, human food is brought here only in small batches. Basically, it is canned food of all kinds, bread, vodka, more than that in detail. How lucky, in general. About the prices better, do not even start, I listen to it a hundred times a day. If you want to eat normally - pay. Deficiency is a deficit. True, the Zone itself is a dangerous place, therefore it is normal to take health risks here. So the local guys have long been accustomed to getting their own food from everything that comes to hand under the arm. And it usually turns something evil and radioactive ... But surprisingly nutritious, because meat - it's also mutants meat. Wild boars, flesh, chimeras - this is the most relish. And the fonite is not so strong, and the taste of the same simple pork is not distinguishable. Some of this meat is then mixed with bread, wrapped in paper and left for several days to allow radiation to be removed. Radiation can be and is displayed, but here the smell from the resulting "product" is no longer that good.<text>

		<text>Why do not I see any weapons on sale? I would like to buy a gun, or better, a shotgun.</text>
	</string>

		<text>It is not allowed for me to trade weapons. It's forbidden by the soldiers. What If I sell a weapon right under their noses to some idiot, and then he shoots half the checkpoint? They will equalize our whole camp with the ground, and they will put me on the wall. And at least some guarantee that I was not involved in this case. Say thank you, that I managed to agree on the ammunition. Caliber, though weak, will be enough till you leave the Cordon. A large game in our places almost does not arrive.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_about_0111">
		<text>Nothing really interesting. I was a Clear Sky member until the The Second Emission happened, then i left the swamps to Cordon. In Cordon, Sidorovich saved my ass so I started working with him. And after getting some connections in trading world, I left Cordon to go to The North - Skadovsk. There I established my own business, I started selling rare weapons and equipment. Everything was going fine until those damn fanatics reactivated Brain Scorcher so I went back where I started - to Cordon, i do not expect any serious orders in here, so my business is not as good as it was.</text>

		<text>Tell me, where could I hunt for artifacts, if that's not much of a secret of course?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_about_0121">
		<text>Artifacts? You won't find anything here, you should move further into The Zone. But don't forget to take a couple of containers with you, a better gas mask and a reliable detector. Try walking into anomalous areas, that's what I can tell you. You can find many artefcats in piles of garbage. "Ignots" are fairly common over there. If you found any, pack them inside your containers and head over to the swamps, you should find good buyers there. The guys are usually generous. I have been dealing with them for a long time, never failed me. They accept mutants parts too, good deal if you ask me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_about_01211">
		<text>How much can I get for this "Ignot"</text>
	</string>

		<text>Five or six thousand, if I remember correctly. Good money. This artefact can save your life one day.</text>

		<text>Here's your Steppe Eagle. It turned out trickier than I thought. Some kind of pistol buff showed a lot of interest, but I barely snatched it in time. See for yourself - a hand-crafted gun, components are all adjusted with unmatched precision. Ever wonder what a perfect sniper pistol would look like? Well, this is it. You owe me 2,800 extra.</text>

		<text>Behold the Alpine - a real beauty. You can rest assured this pistol is one of a kind in the whole Zone. A unique model, very limited issue commissioned for a single special unit. It wasn't easy to obtain, I even had to involve one of my overseas associates. An expanded magazine, extra hard steel barrel, receiver made of extra strong polymers. Add the remaining 2,800 and this baby's yours.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_131">
		<text>Lookit, this is March. The pistol belonged to a mercenary called Wolfhound. A compact high-calibre shooter with short blowback and a lightened bolt. Wolfhound was one hundred percent scum, but he knew his weapons, gotta give him that. They say his favourite trick was to blow all four of his victims' limbs off and then his head - before it hit the ground. Anyway, that'll be 2,800.</text>

		<text>Here you go - Cutter, a submachine gun. Let me say it right off, don't you mind the appearance. It's a brand new model, not in serial production yet. It's a prototype, fresh from the armoury. The designers aimed to make a new-generation close-range weapon: a combination of high calibre, rapid fire and accuracy. So that'll be 8,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_212">

		<text>I reckon this is just what you need. Eliminator, a latest development. The whole batch was supposed to be shipped to Central Africa, but I got a 'sample' as a special favour from friends. An automatic shotgun with a large magazine and an excellent rate of fire. Yours for only 8,000.</text>

		<text>Here's Tide. Based on a silent sniper rifle, it was specifically designed for military units to fight zombies. Tide yields rate of fire in favour of stopping power, allowing the sniper to pick off zombies one by one without disclosing his location. However, it then became clear that stalkers alone will be enough to stop zombies at the Barrier, so the rifle never reached mass production. This baby's yours for an extra 16,000.</text>

		<text>Here. This is an SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. I bought it off Mac, the legendary Freedom guard. He swore there are no others like it in the whole Zone. It's an exclusive item, at least in these parts. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>

		<text>Sure, just look at Lynx here.  Hand-crafted by a local expert. He's deceased now, so there won't be any copies. It looks just like any other rifle, but take it out for some target practice and you'll feel all the difference. It's got a perfect combination of accuracy and stopping power.

		<text>Look here. I managed to get everything off my list - a CS-3a with a helmet. The helmet is nothing special on its own, but it allows for installing a mobile tactical complex, which includes a high-quality night vision system and an active infrared sensor. Now, the CS-3a armour is a real beauty. Excellent protection from bullets and anomalies is a rare feature indeed in a suit as light and mobile as this one. The whole thing will cost you 32,000.</text>

		<text>Something high-calibre and with rapid fire capability, okay… The regular price is 20,000, with a 4,000 advance payment. What do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_132">
		<text>You're a tough customer. I'll have to charge you 24,000 and I need 8,000 paid in advance. Deal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_133">
		<text>Right now is a bad time… the military are making things hot at the Cordon. Someone attacked their outpost the other day, which made them even more difficult to deal with.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_14">
		<text>A sniper weapon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_141">
		<text>For you I can get the best for only 20,000, but you'll have to pay me 4,000 in advance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_142">
		<text>Working with you entails a certain amount of risk… I can try to arrange your order for 24,000, but you'll need to make a 8,000 down payment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_143">
		<text>Sorry, this type of weapon is hard to come by right now. My contact for sniper stuff is… let's say he's indisposed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_15">
		<text>An armoured suit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_151">
		<text>Yeah, I can think of something… suitable. It'll cost you 40,000, but you'll have to pay me 8,000 in advance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_152">
		<text>Yeah, I can think of something… suitable. You refused to collect your last order, so the price will be 48,000 and you'll have to pay me 16,000 in advance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_153">
		<text>I won't be able to do any better than the last suit I got for you. That one was both unique and top of the line.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_16">
		<text>A suit with a closed-cycle respiratory module.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_161">
		<text>That's a tall order… Won't be easy to obtain, not by a long shot. I can try to get one of these babies for 30,000, but I have to ask for a down payment of 6,000.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_162">
		<text>You let me down on the last order, so I have to think twice this time. I can try to get one of these babies for 36,000, but I have to ask for a down payment of 12,000.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_163">
		<text>I bent over backwards to get the last one. Don't think I'll be able to repeat that.</text>

		<text>An exoskeleton.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_171">
		<text>You must have given this choice a lot of thought. I can get my hands on a combat version, but it'll cost you 60,000. Expensive, I know, but well worth it. Keep in mind I'll need 12,000 of that paid right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_172">
		<text>You didn't treat me very nicely on the last order, so this one'll set you back 72,000. Keep in mind I'll need 24,000 of that paid right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_173">
		<text>No way. Since they closed the manufacturing plant, vacant exoskeletons are typically found only on corpses… That's just not my method.</text>
