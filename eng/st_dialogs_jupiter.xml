		<text>Let’s have a look…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_2">
		<text>Let’s have a look… Well, your liver is bigger than I’d expect, but that’s an occupational hazard, right? Apart from that, you’re as healthy as a burer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_111">
		<text>Well, you definitely need a treatment. But I won’t do anything for free. I take 2000 for full health treatment regardless of your problems. This does not include irradiation removing, which will cost you separately 1500 RU.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_11">
		<text>And what do you think? Am I dead already?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_1111">
		<text>Alright. I’ll pay. After all, I won’t take money to the grave.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_1112">
		<text>That shit is just too expensive for me.</text>

	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_1115">
		<text>I won’t pay you so much! I’d rather die!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_1114">
		<text>I choose the option for the poor people. Radiation only, please.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_stalker_medik_need_health_care_1113">

		<text>So, what have you got to say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_start_dialog_12">
		<text>What’s your business here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_0">
		<text>Tell me about Freedom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_1">
		<text>It’s a long story. What do you want to know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_1111">
		<text>What is it that you do here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_11111">
		<text>We’re making sure that various officials don’t conceal anything from the common folk. You know how it is: as soon as they find a new lab or some documents that shed light on the secrets of the Zone, they immediately organize a military operation and clean everything up better than a friggin’ hoover. The only way of finding shit out is by getting there first.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_1112">
		<text>What brought you to the center of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_11121">
		<text>Well, the boys felt like taking a stroll in a new place… Just kidding. It’s an opportunity to find stuff that the world ain’t seen before. Neither the army nor stalkers have been here before, so there’s something new everywhere you look.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_111211">
		<text>Did you find anything?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_1112111">
		<text>A couple of locked doors and some weird new artefacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_1113">
		<text>How did you end up in Freedom?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_11131">
		<text>Well, I was friends with Freedom leaders back when there was no Zone. Mind you, in those days, they weren’t leaders: they were regular hippies. So, when I made a move into the Zone in search of artefacts and ran into familiar faces, I figured I might as well go with what I know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_1114">
		<text>What do you think about Duty?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_11141">
		<text>They’re idiots, that’s what I think. I mean, why the hell would they want to destroy the Zone? It’s not consuming precious resources or getting bigger… or anything. They could just sit there and study it to their heart’s content. Just think of how many scientific discoveries could be made… I mean, in the history of man-kind, no one has never been able to understand anti-gravitation, right? And in the Zone, you’ve got ready-made anti-gravitation devices lying all over the place. It wouldn’t hurt to kick their asses out of here, but it’s too much hassle.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_1115">
		<text>Okay. Forget about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_a6_freedom_leader_about_you_11151">
		<text>No problem.</text>

		<text>Hah, you don’t expect me to believe that, do you? I’ve heard a lot about the Oasis but I’ve NEVER heard of anyone who has actually been there. I will just believe in the Oasis as much as I believe in Pink Unicorns and Tentacled Gods. And that comes down to a healthy skepticism.</text>
