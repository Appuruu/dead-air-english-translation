		<text>A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output is highest on the artifact radiation scale. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artifact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artifact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,225,225] • %c[0,140,140,140] highly valuable</text>

		<text>This artifact is formed in anomalous zones with intense thermal activity. Actively consumes excessive heat and remains cool at all times. It will also protect the user against acids found in toxic and chemical anomalies. On the other hand, exposure to such environments makes the artifact increase the corrosivity of acids due to unknown as of now mechanism. For this reason, one is forced to weigh pros and cons of Crystal when in the vicinity of areas of high toxicity. It also acts as a conductor of electricity. Another positive effect possessed by this artifact is that it accelerates clotting if worn close to the body. (Side note: it is not recommended to keep this artifact in your possession for longer periods of time as blood clots can be hazardous to your health.) This artifact is also highly sought for by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1 cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artifact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in death of the user.

The usefulness of the artifact, however, is not limited to its industrial applications. There is scientific evidence suggesting that sapphire-like stones effectively protect from toxicity, whereas the outer shell slightly increases resistance to heat.

Mama's Beads also possess potent protective qualities: they are able to shield the body and objects from extreme heat and acids. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artifact increases the corrosivity of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to tissues of any living organism. It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of Mama's Beads. Another dangerous effect of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artifact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.

Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user's body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artifact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artifact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artifact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish.

It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artifact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artifact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artifact on the belt is suicide.

Stability of temperature is the cause of another of its positive effects: it accelerates healing rate and stops bleeding. It will also protect the user from chemical burns. However, it is unrecommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artifact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in user's bloodstream.

One drawback of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artifact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones.

On the other hand, it will protect the user from harmful effects of fire anomalies found throughout the Zone and from acids of chemical/toxic anomalies.

While this phenomenon leaves the artifact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artifact.

		<text>Артефакт растительного происхождения, внешне похож на утыканный иглами ржавый шар. При втыкании артефакта в кожу, кончики игл начинают потепенный вывод углеводов из крови, аккумулируя их в ядре артефакта, при этом в кровь выделяется фермент, уменьшающий чувствительность носителя к порезам. По утверждению учёных, «Колючка» является семенем аномалии «Жгучий пух», что подтверждается его поведением: артефакт цепляется за кожу или впутывается в шерсть живых существ, проходящих мимо, и начинает созревать, паразитируя на теле. При этом в кровь выделяется фермент, делающий кожу более грубой и устойчивой к порезам и разрыву, что повышает шансы на выживание хозяина и семени-паразите на нём. В конце созревания артефакт отваливается и, при удачном стечении обстоятельств, образует новую аномалию. Обнаружить его можно у аномалий «Жгучий пух», неподалёку от них, или на теле крупных мутантов.
